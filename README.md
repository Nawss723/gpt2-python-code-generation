"Code-Generation-GPT2" 

Overview of the AI Model:

This project leverages the GPT-2 model, a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI, to generate Python code. GPT-2 is trained to predict the next word or token in a sequence, making it ideal for tasks like code generation. By fine-tuning GPT-2 on a custom dataset that includes Python code snippets, we can improve its ability to generate functional and coherent code.

How it Works:

1.Pre-trained GPT-2: GPT-2 has already been trained on vast amounts of natural language data, so it understands the structure and patterns of language.
2.Fine-tuning for Code Generation: We customize this pre-trained model to better handle Python syntax and code structure by training it on a specialized dataset containing Python instructions and input examples.
3.Dataset Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and tokenized so that the model can process it effectively. Each piece of code is tokenized into smaller parts (tokens) which the model then uses to learn patterns in the code.
4.Model Training: We fine-tune GPT-2 by training it on the custom Python dataset, allowing it to become more adept at generating code given an initial prompt.
5.Code Generation: After training, the model can generate Python code based on the provided prompt, continuing from the input to produce complete functions or code blocks.
6.Colab Implementation: The code runs in Google Colab, making it easy to access and train the model without the need for local computational resources.




This project shows how an AI model, typically trained on natural language, can be fine-tuned to generate structured and syntactically correct Python code. The flexibility of GPT-2 allows it to learn new tasks like this through transfer learning and dataset-specific training.
